## Basic Information

We are a community group of [Grace Presbyterian Church](https://gracepres.com/) that meets every other week in Palo Alto and Menlo Park. The co-leaders of the group of Carl and Ruth Case and Jon and Allison Quick.

We rotate meeting locations on Thursday nights from 5:30-7:30pm. The rough schedule is:
- 5:30-6:30pm: Arrival, potluck dinner / feed the kids, social time
- 6:30-7:15pm: Bible study for the adults
- 7:15-7:30pm: Prayer

Kids are welcome! Many of our CG regulars have children ages 1-4. We try to provide a play area for the kids and rotate off checking in on them. We also simply embrace the chaos of gathering with small children.

Our current study is the book of Revelation ([part 1](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/revelation-1-11/) and [part 2](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/revelation-12-22/)), and it will run through the end of the school year. Past studies are listed below.
