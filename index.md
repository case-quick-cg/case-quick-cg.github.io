## Basic Information
We are a community group of [Grace Presbyterian Church](https://gracepres.com/) that meets every other week in Palo Alto and Menlo Park. The co-leaders of the group of Carl and Ruth Case and Jon and Allison Quick.

We rotate meeting locations on Thursday nights from 5:30-7:30pm. The rough schedule is:
- 5:30-6:30pm: Arrival, potluck dinner / feed the kids, social time
- 6:30-7:15pm: Bible study for the adults
- 7:15-7:30pm: Prayer

Kids are welcome! Many of our CG regulars have children ages 1-4. We try to provide a play area for the kids and rotate off checking in on them. We also simply embrace the chaos of gathering with small children.

Our current study is: [The Character of God](https://bibleproject.com/explore/category/character-of-god-series/).
